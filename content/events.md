  <h3>Dev Talks</h3>

  <h3>Level Up</h3>
  <p>Bi-weekly, every other Monday.</p>

<div class="col-sm-3">
  <h3>Code & Coffee</h3>
  <p>Thursday mornings at 7:00am.</p>
  <p>Start your day off right with this informal get together. Bring your laptop, enjoy some coffee, and hang out with other developers. Come whenever, leave whenever. Oh, and sometimes there are donuts.</p>

<div class="col-sm-3">
  <h3>Hangout</h3>
  <p>Monthly, every second Tuesday.</p>
  <p>The Hangout is a social event and an opportunity to hang out, talk code (or not) and enjoy some company. Sometimes we make things. Sometimes we have a beer or two. Always a good time.</p>
