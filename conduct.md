devICT is dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion,
technical ability, or software preferences. We do not tolerate harassment in
any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any devICT meetup
or chatroom.

**Anyone violating these rules may be asked to leave the meetup or chatroom at
the discretion of devICT organizers.**

Harassment includes

* Offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability,
  physical appearance, body size, race, religion, technical ability or software
  preferences
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, organizers, and speakers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the [Geek
Feminism wiki](https://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment),
created by the Geek Feminism community.
