      "description": "<p>Every Monday night at the Labor Party from 7:00 to 9:00 we host a casual gathering with the focus on coding. Feel free to bring whatever snacks and/or drinks you wish for yourself or to share, but no food is provided.</p> <p>Do you want to learn something new?</p> <p>Pick an on-line class and come out here to work on it every week. You'll be amazed at how fast you progress! If you get stuck or have questions, we have people here to help. Just ask on devICT slack or yell out and we'll help you out. Not sure where to start? We've all been there and can recommend resources.</p> <p>- Do you have a programming book you want to read but end up rereading The Hobbit again every time you have free time? Come out to the LP every Monday night and read with us. We don't have any nasty hobbitses.</p> <p>- Do you have a personal project you want to work on but end up binge watching Netflix every night instead?<br/>- Do you have a group project you want to work on, but cannot find a good time and place to meet?<br/>- Do you just want to meet local developers in a low key setting where you are free to open your laptop and look at cat pictures when your social anxiety takes over?</p> <p>Come out to the Study Hall!</p> <p>Be sure to bring a laptop to work on!</p>",
